Join me on my journey of understanding the world through analytics.

## About Me
Hello, my name is I'm Pierson and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst living in the Midwest. As a problem solver who's passionate about leveraging data to contextualize my surrounding world, I particularly enjoy creating engaging visualizations using data related to social issues, sports, or other topics that impact my life on a daily basis. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to acquire new skills and look forward to displaying more of my work in the near future.

## Education
* Current Master's Candidate at the University of Notre Dame studying Business Analytics
* Vanderbilt University alumnus where I studied Political Science and played collegiate athletics
* Completed Google Career Certificate in Data Analytics offered through Coursera

## Projects
* Lululemon Mens Pants Analysis- scraped product and review information from the Lululemon website in order to build an interactive dashboard for Educators (sales associates) to understand trends in customer reviews
* Nashville Police Stops- analyzed police interactions in Nashville in order to understand if there are any systematic differences in the way police stop and arrest people based on different demographics
* Field Goal Probability- predicted the probability of NFL kickers making field goals based on a number of variables to better understand which variables have the most predicted impact on whether a kick is successful
* Star Wars Networks- visualized the networks of characters in the Star Wars universe and identified specific variables that were associated with whether specific characters interacted across the films
