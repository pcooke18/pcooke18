Join me on my journey of undestranding the world through analytics.

## About Me
Hello, my name is I'm Pierson and I'm an aspiring Data Analyst living in the Midwest. I'm a problem solver who's passionate about leveraging data to contextualize the world around. I'm particularly interested in Sports Analytics and social issues affecting minority communities. I am constantly seeking opportunities to acquire new skills and look forward to building out repositories with some of my work in the near future.

## Education
* Current Master's Candidate at the University of Notre Dame studying Business Analytics
* Vanderbilt University alumnus where I studied Political Science and played collegiate athletics
* Completed Google Career Certificate in Data Analytics offered through Coursera

## Projects
* Lululemon Mens Pants Analysis- scraped product and review information from the Lululemon website in order to build an interactive dashboard for Educators (sales associates) to better understand what customers like and dislike about specific types of products
* Nashville Police Stops- analyzed police interactions in Nashville in order to understand if there are any stystematic differences in the way police stop and arrest people based on different demographics
* Field Goal Probability- predicted the probability of NFL kickers making field goals based on a number of variables to better understand which variables have the most predicted impact on whether a kick is successful
* Star Wars Networks- analyzed the networks of characters in the Star Wars universe and identified specific variables that were associated with whether specific characters interacted across the films
